## 2026-05-18 — chris-cc — bootstrap DEVLOG.md

- Created this `DEVLOG.md`. CLAUDE.md already existed in this repo (last touched 2026-04-05); not modified.
- No code changes.
- Captures current state: GSH is fully on LLC CF (zone moved + worker + D1 + R2 all live on LLC as of 2026-05-11/2026-05-17), Personal-account leftovers all deleted, apex serves HTTP 200 via the LLC `goodsoilharvest` worker.

### NEXT

- Sentinel currently flags 9 Next.js advisories on this repo (`#771, #776, #778, #779, #773, #775, #777, #780, #772, #774` — mix of high/medium/low) — part of the org-wide Next.js wave (17 findings across GSH + Openclaw-Maximus). Auto-fix PRs are queued; will dispatch once GH Actions cap resets 2026-06-01.
- Daily Good Soil blog cron continues to run nightly (~03:00). The `cf-pages-migration` branch is stale (0 ahead / 17 behind main) — abandon it during cleanup per MASTER-TODO.
